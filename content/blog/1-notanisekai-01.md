Summary: The Beginning

> This is a draft, it'll probably change.

The pits of hell must be more welcoming than this place. Since my arrival I’ve been unable to shake the pure dread dripping from here now. The darkness had become overwhelming, the sun never shining through the smoke from the fires, burning wood and bodies.  Rot had begun to take over the forest around me, leaving only the dead and those that feed on them. The new inhabitants of this land destroy everything around them, leaving only fire, destruction and death in their wake.

 I once protected the land from these beasts. For decades we had known peace. We’d see the monsters, but never enough to take anything. They were content cannibalizing themselves, destroying their already destroyed land. No one expected them to attack in force. When they came, many of the guard had become lazy and complacent. We only noticed things too late when they were already on top of us.

The walls were cold that day. Not unbearably so, but just cold enough to make your fingers stiff. I had gone to look over the wall into the fog, as we’d been hearing noises out there. I thought I saw small flock of birds. How I wish it was. Last night we’d sent out a patrol that hadn’t come back. We’d thought they were simply late. But there they came. Well, pieces of them. The monsters must have cut their limbs off and put them into a trebuchet. As they flew over, I saw human arms and legs. I didn’t count. I didn’t need to. I knew exactly how many there were.

Just as I was thinking that it couldn’t get any worse, it did. My comrades were alive. Their arms and legs had made it back, but the rest of them were coming through the mist, dragged on chains and hanging from metal cages. Legless, armless. When they got closer, we could hear their screams, the only thing they could do.

“What in—”

A giant boulder crashed into the wall below me.

“Oh, fuck.”

As I felt the wall start to collapse under me, I yelled out: “We’re under attack! The beasts are—”

Nothing seemed real. As I was falling, I managed to somehow avoid being crushed by the collapsing tower above me. More rocks came flying from the mist across the river. Even with the noise of stone and wood crumbling, one could still hear those piercing screams. A piece of the wall struck my helmet, and before blacking out and being covered by rubble, I saw some of the beasts running towards other breaks in the wall.

I woke up, my mouth dry, one of my arms fell limp at my side, probably broken. Somehow that was all the injury I’d sustained. Everyone else was not so lucky. My head swam as I sat up, looking around in a daze.

The battle that followed had been bloody and drawn out. The barracks we lived in were burned and collapsed. Crows had come and were picking at the dead on both sides. The ground was dark with fire and blood. I was alone, surrounded by death. There were dozens of dead from both sides. Limbs missing, some seemingly cut off after the battle. Intestines that had been ripped by hooks lay at the feet of some.

Nothing could have been more startling than hearing a human voice at that time.

“…nor…”

I almost didn’t hear it, but in the dead silence of the place even the tiniest whisper was distinguishable. The crows were even quiet.

“Cuinor…is that…” I turned, but there was no one there. Just the leaning corner of one of the burned down buildings.

“Here…I’m here…” the man coughed. He sounded in pain, more excruciating than I could imagine. The voice was above me. I almost feared what I would see. I was right to fear it. Above me, the monsters had affixed one of the cages they’d come in with. It was a round device, about a man tall, and half that wide, but what was inside was no man.  I had been looking at the ground, incredulous to the destruction there, so I had not seen what was above me.

“Fornion, is that you? What the hell have they done to you?” In place of arms and legs only stumps remained. One of Fornion’s eyes was closed, and the lids seemed a bit too loose for anything to be in there anymore.

“I’ve been hanging here, waiting for someone. Anyone.” He looked so relieved, but it was still a horrible sight. “They’d been giving me water with a sponge till yesterday.” His lips were chapped, and as he spoke, a cut opened and began to bleed slowly. Dark, brown blood.

“Kill me.”

Had I heard him correctly? Fornion, one of our strongest rangers, was asking to die. I took a step back.

“Please. I can’t go on like this. I can’t go back to my…” He drifted off. The light in his eye seemed to be so faded. At that moment I took pity on him. There was nothing he could do. Even if I could get him out of the cage, he could no longer take care of himself at all. This land was no longer safe. Anyone here would have to be able to defend themselves, and Fornion could no longer do that. “Just find a spear. You should be able to find one somewhere.”

I wandered off, slowly, trying to see if an intact spear was anywhere. I’d seen plenty of broken swords and spears, but the beasts had taken everything of use and destroyed what they couldn’t carry with them it seemed.

As I walked into one of the burned-out barracks buildings, I was grabbed from behind. Something grabbed my arm and I cried out in pain. My vision went black from pain. I could feel the bone stabbing into my flesh. The break wasn’t clean, but jagged and extremely painful. My walk to Fornion I’d carried it gingerly and walked slowly, but no more. I was dragged out of the barracks by rough hands. There was a square in the middle of the fort where we would run drills and practice. It was filled with bodies, except for the raised platform at the north edge. As I was thrown into the courtyard, I screamed as I landed on my arm.

I looked up to see something I had always heard about but never though could actually exist. It was the King of the Beasts. Almost two men tall, it towered over everyone around. Its face was horribly disfigured. The skin on it had been peeled back in places and armor plating placed underneath. It seemed almost fused to the bone. Blades stuck vertically out of its back. Not swords or anything, just blades. Its armor seemed to almost have fused with its body. And on its head sat a crown. Something only drawn in books, it seemed to give off an aura. The world looked darker around the Kind of Beasts. Next to him were two more cages, with two more of the scouting party in them. Both were blind and seemed to have no idea what was even going on. They simply made whimpering noises as the King sat.

When the beasts that grabbed me spoke, it was not a human tongue. It was from no land that I recognized, but they seemed to be reporting to the King. The King stood up. It had seemed tall sitting on the chair from our mess hall, but as it stood, a cloak flowed behind it.

Its eyes were almost human as it looked between the beasts and me. The irises a piercing dark blue, almost too blue. It walked towards me slowly, moving in the direction of the beast who held my broken arm.

I could see the anger in those eyes as they approached. What they were angry about, I had no idea. Instead of pulling a sword from a scabbard at his hip, he simply pulled one of the blades from his back out. The blade was straight but blackened. At the base where the King held it, there were barbs, with longer barbs where a hilt would be. It seemed not to care at all as the wound it was pulled from closed almost immediately. There was no blood on the blade, even, in fact it was sparkling clean, almost mesmerizing.

One second I was staring at the sword. As one of the beasts tried to talk in their language to the King, both the speaking and the sword vanished.

The head of one of the beasts lay at my side. A tired fury flashed in the King’s eyes, as it looked at me, those piercingly bright blue eyes staring into mine.

“I speak some of your tongue, human. I have no need to waste my time, but my gods desire sacrifice before leaving.” I looked around, seeing all the bodies, all the blood, everywhere. “Those are not good enough for my gods,” it said. “Nor are you.”

The blade seemed to speak as the King brought the sword to my throat.

“But my swords seem to like you, so I shall simply kill you, unlike your fellow men,” it gestured back at the cages. It seemed to feed on terror, and it relished in my comrades pain and suffering, but I wasn’t going to give any to him. “You don’t need to. You simply need to die.”

He pressed the blade against my throat and slid the blade across my throat as he walked past me. The life left me, and I felt myself floating into the blackness, but I never reached it. Instead I ended up somewhere much worse.
